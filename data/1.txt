Technical Report: Camera Selection for 
Jetson-Based YOLO Detection System 
Executive Summary 
This report evaluates camera options for a computer vision system with the following 
requirements: clear video capture at 15-meter distance, compatibility with NVIDIA Jetson 
platform, real-time YOLO object detection processing, and minimum 1.5-meter physical 
separation between camera and processing unit. After comprehensive analysis of eight camera 
solutions, the e-con Systems GMSL camera series emerges as the optimal choice for this 
application. 
Project Requirements 
Primary Specifications 
● Detection range: 15 meters minimum 
● Platform: NVIDIA Jetson (Nano/Xavier/Orin series) 
● Processing: Real-time YOLO object detection 
● Physical constraint: Minimum 1.5-meter cable distance between camera and Jetson 
Performance Considerations 
● Frame rate: Minimum 30 fps for real-time detection 
● Resolution: Sufficient pixel density for object identification at 15 meters 
● Latency: Low latency critical for real-time processing 
● Reliability: Industrial-grade stability for continuous operation 
Camera Technologies Overview 
Interface Types Evaluated 
USB 3.0 Interface USB cameras provide widespread compatibility and straightforward 
integration with Jetson platforms through V4L2 and OpenCV libraries. Standard USB 3.0 cables 
are limited to approximately 3 meters, requiring active extension cables or USB-over-Ethernet 
adapters for longer distances. This introduces potential reliability concerns and additional 
complexity. 
HDMI Interface HDMI cameras offer excellent cable extension capabilities up to 10 meters with 
standard cables, or 50+ meters using HDMI-over-Cat6 extenders. However, this approach 
requires an additional HDMI capture device (USB capture dongle or HDMI-to-CSI adapter), 
which introduces additional latency and system complexity. 
MIPI CSI-2 Interface CSI cameras provide the lowest latency connection to Jetson platforms 
through direct ribbon cable connections to the CSI ports. Standard CSI ribbon cables are 
typically limited to 30-100 centimeters, making them unsuitable for applications requiring 1.5+ 
meter separation without additional extension hardware. 
GMSL (Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link) Interface GMSL technology utilizes coaxial cables to 
transmit high-bandwidth video over longer distances (15+ meters) while maintaining low latency. 
This automotive-grade technology provides robust signal integrity and is specifically designed 
for embedded vision applications. GMSL cameras connect to Jetson platforms through 
deserializer boards that interface with the native CSI-2 ports.
