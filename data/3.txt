Maximum Image Quality Priority: For applications requiring absolute maximum image quality 
and where cost is secondary, the Basler aceA5472-17uc provides superior performance. 
Recommended configuration: 
● Operate in 1920x1080 ROI mode for 60+ fps 
● High-quality C-mount lens: 16mm or 25mm focal length 
● USB3 Vision repeater for cable extension 
● Expected total cost: 900-1200 USD 
This configuration provides exceptional image quality while maintaining real-time frame rates 
but at 3x the cost of the e-con GMSL solution. 
Implementation Considerations 
Lens Selection for 15-Meter Detection 
For cameras with C-mount capability (Basler, some Arducam, some ELP), lens selection 
significantly impacts detection performance: 
Field of View Calculation: 
● Horizontal FOV = 2 × arctan(sensor_width / (2 × focal_length)) 
● For 15-meter detection range, optimal FOV depends on detection area size 
Recommended Focal Lengths: 
● Wide area coverage (10m x 15m): 6-8mm lens 
● Medium area (5m x 8m): 12-16mm lens 
● Narrow area (2m x 3m): 25-35mm lens 
Lens Quality Considerations: 
● Minimum specifications: Multi-coated optics, f/1.4 or faster aperture 
● Budget: 50-100 USD 
● Professional: 150-300 USD 
● Superior optics at longer focal lengths improve detection accuracy 
Lighting Requirements 
Adequate illumination is critical for reliable detection at 15-meter distance: 
Minimum Illumination Levels: 
● Indoor: 300-500 lux for reliable detection 
● Outdoor daylight: Generally adequate (10,000+ lux) 
● Outdoor nighttime: Supplemental lighting required (LED floodlights recommended) 
Camera Specifications: 
● Minimum illumination rating: 0.1 lux or better 
● HDR capability recommended for variable lighting environments 
● Auto-exposure with customizable parameters 
Jetson Platform Selection 
The camera choice impacts optimal Jetson platform selection: 
e-con GMSL Cameras: 
● Requires: Jetson Xavier NX (minimum), AGX Xavier, Orin NX, or AGX Orin 
● Not compatible: Jetson Nano (original) 
● Recommended: Jetson Orin NX (16GB) for 4K YOLO processing 
USB/HDMI Cameras: 
● Compatible: All Jetson models including Nano 
● Recommended: Jetson Xavier NX or better for 4K processing 
● Jetson Nano adequate for 1080p processing 
Software Configuration 
Driver Installation: For e-con GMSL cameras, install BSP (Board Support Package) provided 
by e-con Systems. This includes kernel drivers and device tree modifications. 
Recommended Software Stack: 
1. JetPack SDK (current version) 
2. OpenCV with CUDA support 
3. GStreamer with hardware acceleration plugins 
4. NVIDIA DeepStream SDK for optimized YOLO inference 
5. TensorRT for model optimization 
Camera Configuration: 
● Set exposure manually for consistent YOLO performance 
● Disable auto white-balance during training data collection 
● Configure ROI if not using full sensor area 
● Enable hardware ISP for optimal performance 
Performance Optimization 
YOLO Model Selection for Real-Time Processing: 
● YOLOv5s or YOLOv8n: 60+ fps on Jetson Orin at 1080p 
● YOLOv5m or YOLOv8s: 30-45 fps on Jetson Orin at 1080p 
● YOLOv5l or YOLOv8m: 15-30 fps on Jetson Orin at 1080p 
Resolution Trade-offs: 
● 1920x1080: Maximum frame rate, adequate for most applications 
● 2560x1440: Balanced resolution and performance 
● 3840x2160: Maximum detection accuracy, reduced frame rate 
DeepStream Pipeline Optimization: Utilize NVIDIA DeepStream SDK for production 
deployments to achieve: 
● Hardware-accelerated video decode 
● TensorRT inference optimization 
● Multi-stream processing capability 
● Reduced CPU utilization 
Risk Analysis 
Technical Risks by Solution 
ELP USB Cameras: 
● Risk: Inconsistent image quality between units 
● Mitigation: Purchase multiple units for testing, select best performer 
● Risk: USB extension reliability 
● Mitigation: Use high-quality active cables, implement connection monitoring 
HDMI Cameras (Marshall, Mokose): 
● Risk: Capture card latency impacts real-time performance 
● Mitigation: Select low-latency capture devices (Elgato Cam Link 4K), test end-to-end 
latency 
● Risk: Additional failure point in system 
● Mitigation: Industrial-grade capture cards, redundant systems for critical applications 
Basler Cameras: 
● Risk: High initial investment 
● Mitigation: Justified for production deployments, consider refurbished units for 
prototyping 
● Risk: SDK complexity 
● Mitigation: Allocate development time for Pylon SDK integration, leverage Basler 
technical support 
e-con GMSL Cameras: 
● Risk: Platform lock-in (Jetson-specific) 
● Mitigation: Acceptable for embedded vision applications, standard for 
automotive/robotics industries 
● Risk: Deserializer board failure 
● Mitigation: Professional-grade components, low historical failure rates, spare boards for 
critical applications 
Arducam IMX477: 
● Risk: Does not meet cable distance requirement 
● Mitigation: Not recommended for this application without significant modifications 
Deployment Considerations 
Environmental Factors: 
● Indoor controlled environment: All evaluated cameras suitable 
● Outdoor or variable temperature: Select STURDeCAM20 (IP67, -40°C to 85°C) or 
ruggedized enclosures 
● Vibration/shock: Industrial cameras (Basler, e-con) preferred, secure mounting critical 
Power Requirements: 
● USB cameras: Powered by Jetson USB port (typically adequate) 
● GMSL cameras: Power-over-Coax from deserializer board (powered by Jetson carrier 
board) 
● High-power cameras: May require external power supply, factor into system design 
Maintenance and Support: 
● Consumer cameras (ELP, Mokose): Limited manufacturer support, plan for replacement 
● Professional cameras (Basler, e-con, Marshall): Multi-year warranties, responsive 
technical support 
● Spare parts: Stock spare cameras and cables for production systems 
Conclusion 
Based on comprehensive technical evaluation, the e-con Systems GMSL camera series, 
specifically the NileCAM87 model, represents the optimal solution for Jetson-based YOLO 
object detection at 15-meter range with minimum 1.5-meter camera-to-processor separation. 
This recommendation is supported by: 
1. Perfect Requirement Alignment: The included 15-meter coaxial cable directly solves 
the cable distance requirement without additional hardware or complexity. 
2. Optimal Technical Specifications: 4K resolution at 44 fps provides the ideal balance 
between detection accuracy at 15 meters and real-time processing capability. 
3. Superior System Integration: Native GMSL-to-CSI interface provides the lowest 
latency of all evaluated solutions, critical for real-time detection applications. 
4. Cost-Effectiveness: At 300-500 USD including cable, the total system cost is 
competitive with USB solutions requiring extension hardware and significantly less than 
Basler industrial cameras while providing comparable image quality. 
5. Proven Technology: GMSL is the established standard for automotive and robotics 
vision applications, providing confidence in long-term reliability and performance. 
6. Scalability: Multi-camera capability enables future system expansion without 
architectural changes. 
Alternative recommendations are provided for budget-constrained applications (ELP USB 
cameras) and maximum-quality requirements (Basler aceA5472-17uc), but these alternatives 
involve significant compromises in either image quality, reliability, cost, or system complexity 
compared to the e-con GMSL solution. 
For production deployment of Jetson-based YOLO detection systems with the stated 
requirements, the e-con Systems GMSL camera represents the optimal choice that balances 
technical performance, system simplicity, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
