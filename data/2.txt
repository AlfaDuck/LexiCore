Comparative Analysis 
Resolution vs. Frame Rate Trade-offs 
For real-time YOLO object detection, the optimal balance typically falls between 1080p (2MP) 
and 4K (8MP) resolution at 30-60 fps. Higher resolutions provide better object detail at distance 
but reduce frame rates and increase computational load on the Jetson. 
Recommended Minimum Specifications for 15-Meter Detection: 
● Resolution: 1920 x 1080 (adequate) to 3840 x 2160 (optimal) 
● Frame Rate: 30 fps minimum, 60 fps preferred 
● Pixel Density at 15m: Minimum 10 pixels per meter of object width 
Latency Considerations 
End-to-end latency for YOLO detection systems comprises: 
1. Camera sensor exposure and readout: 16-33ms (depending on frame rate) 
2. Interface transmission: 1-5ms (CSI/GMSL) or 30-100ms (USB/HDMI capture) 
3. Jetson processing: Variable based on YOLO model and Jetson model 
4. Display/output: 16-33ms 
The interface transmission latency represents the primary differentiator among camera 
solutions. CSI and GMSL interfaces provide the lowest latency, critical for real-time applications 
requiring rapid response.

Technical Recommendations 
Optimal Solution: e-con Systems GMSL NileCAM87 
The e-con Systems GMSL camera series, specifically the NileCAM87 model, represents the 
optimal solution for this application based on the following technical justifications: 
Alignment with Requirements: 
1. Detection Range: 4K (8MP) resolution provides 3840 pixels horizontal. At 15 meters 
with a 90-degree horizontal field of view, this yields approximately 5-10 pixels per 
centimeter of object width, sufficient for robust YOLO detection of objects 20cm and 
larger. 
2. Jetson Compatibility: Native CSI-2 interface through GMSL deserializer provides direct 
integration with Jetson's ISP (Image Signal Processor), enabling hardware-accelerated 
processing and lowest possible latency. 
3. Real-Time Processing: 44 fps at 4K resolution exceeds the 30 fps minimum 
requirement for real-time YOLO. The Jetson Orin can process YOLOv5/YOLOv8 models 
at 4K resolution at 30-60 fps depending on model size. 
4. Cable Distance: The included 15-meter coaxial cable exceeds the 1.5-meter minimum 
requirement by an order of magnitude, providing installation flexibility without any 
additional hardware or cost. 
Technical Advantages: 
Signal Integrity: GMSL technology uses differential signaling over coaxial cable with 
embedded clock recovery, providing superior electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity 
compared to USB or HDMI. This ensures consistent image quality over the full 15-meter 
distance without signal degradation. 
Latency Performance: Direct CSI-2 connection to Jetson ISP provides end-to-end latency of 
approximately 30-60ms (sensor to memory), compared to 80-150ms for USB capture solutions 
and 100-200ms for HDMI capture solutions. This 2-3x latency reduction is significant for 
real-time detection applications requiring rapid decision-making. 
System Simplicity: Single-cable solution (with Power-over-Coax) eliminates multiple 
connection points and potential failure modes. No capture cards, no extension cables, no 
additional power supplies at camera location. 
Scalability: The GMSL architecture supports up to 8 cameras on a single Jetson AGX Orin, 
enabling future expansion for multi-camera detection systems without platform changes. 
Software Integration: Standard V4L2 driver interface ensures compatibility with OpenCV, 
GStreamer, and NVIDIA DeepStream SDK without proprietary software requirements. This 
simplifies software development and maintenance. 
Alternative Recommendations 
Budget-Constrained Applications (Under 150 USD): If budget constraints preclude the e-con 
GMSL solution, the ELP USB camera with varifocal lens represents the most practical budget 
option. Select models with: 
● Minimum 1080p resolution 
● Manual focus varifocal lens (6-12mm or 5-50mm) 
● USB 3.0 interface 
● Active USB extension cable (5 meters) 
Expected limitations: Image quality marginally adequate at 15 meters, lower reliability, may 
require camera replacement for production deployment.
